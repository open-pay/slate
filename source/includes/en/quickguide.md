# Quick Guide


This is a quick guide to the flow of operation and description of each point in order to accompany the development of the stores. We highly recommend reading the integration specifications in detail before starting to develop.


##Charges with VPOS

Flow Chart of the Operation.

![Cargo VPOS](images/charge-vpos.png)

**Note : All merchants are created by default with 3d Secure authentication and VPOS**

1.- The cardholder enters the web page of the store, selects their products once selected and inside the shopping cart clicks on the option to pay.

2.- The merchant generates a request with a JSON object that contains the fields listed in ["Charges with VPOS"] (#with-vpos). Within the object, a field must be included with the URL to which the flow is redirected at the end of the transaction, whether authorized or rejected.

         **Example of URL:**  	"redirect_url": "https://micomercio.com"

  **Note:** The data that is included in this object is from the purchase. They are not sensitive data.


3.- BBVA returns a response with a JSON object named "transaction" that contains the URL to which the cardholder must be directed to capture the data in the VPOS The field **"id" (string)** is a unique assigned identifier by BBVA at the time of its creation. The merchant has to associate a sale order number with this ID.

4.- The merchant redirects the cardholder to the URL that displays the VPOS, which travels in the Json object named "transaction"

**Example:** "url" :

"https://sand-api.ecommercebbva.com/v1/mptdggroasfcmqs8plpy/charges/trywj1kyx7vczirifkyw/card_capture"

5.- The cardholder, enters the sensitive data in the VPOS, card number, CVV, expiration date, and sends the information directly to BBVA

5.5.- 3d Secure authentication is carried out by the issuing bank of the Debit or Credit Card

6.- BBVA processes the transaction and redirects the cardholder to the URL sent by the merchant in step "2"

7.- The merchant receives the request from the client's browser and uses the id of the transaction to query the result (Authorized or Rejected) through the [Get a Charge](#get-a-charge) service this ID field was associated with the identifier of Order of sale in step number 3.

 **Example of URL:**  "redirect_url": "https://micomercio.com"

 Including in the URL, the ID of the transaction ...

 Ej .- https://www.micomercio.com?**id=tr72356487234bd238d**


 8 .- The merchant makes a request to the [Get a Charge](#get-a-charge) service The status of the transaction is requested from the BBVA server and an object "Transaction object" is answered.

 **Note.-** The merchant generates your purchase receipt based on the information obtained from the object "Get a Charge"
